You can type in an address in or around wake county and you can  search for any existing / proposed greenways within 1-5 miles from the  place you searched.

The map service has been provided from <a target="_blank" href="https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/">Wake County Open Data.</a>

This was a project of my own that I started in order to get used to the ESRI JavaScript 4.0 framework and Angular 5.
