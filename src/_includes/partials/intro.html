      <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
      <p>
        I've been a tech lead, a full-stack web developer (C# back-end, microservices, Angular front-end), worked with Angular, Vue, React and more recently Lit. If my website looks a little plain with that resume it's because I want to limit the footprint of my website as much as possible. That aside, I hope you enjoy my blog posts below and you are welcome to message me on <a class="inline-link" href="#">LinkedIn</a>.
